title: Seed Build Images
---

Seed runs your builds inside a virtual machine and it'll use a build image based on the Lambda runtime of your service. Below is a list of all the images in use:

[**Active Images**](#build-images)

- [General Purpose v5.0](#general-purpose-v50)
- [General Purpose v4.0](#general-purpose-v40)
- [General Purpose v3.0](#general-purpose-v30)
- [General Purpose v1.1](#general-purpose-v11)
- [Python 3.6](#python-36)
- [Python 2.7](#python-27)
- [Ruby 2.5](#ruby-25)

[**Deprecated Images**](#deprecated-build-images)

- [General Purpose v2.0](#general-purpose-v20)
- [General Purpose v1.0](#general-purpose-v10)
- [Python 3.7](#python-37)
- [.NET Core 2.1](#net-core-21)

## Changing the Build Image

By default, Seed will automatically select a build image for your service based on the runtime you have set in your `serverless.yml`. However, Seed will not automatically update this when your runtime is updated. This is done to ensure that any scripts in your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) are not affected by the build image change.

If you want to update the build image that a service in your app is using, head over to the service's settings.

Note that, if a service has not been deployed yet, Seed will not have picked a build image.

You can also check which image was used for a specific build, by heading over to the logs for that build.

## Package Versions

Seed regularly applies security updates to the build images. This means that the minor versions of the packages in a build image can change.

### Node Versions

However for Node.js, the build images also comes with — [n](https://github.com/tj/n). It allows you to select a specific Node.js version if necessary. For example, to select Node.js v10.21.0 you can run this:

```bash
$ n 18.14.0
```

And to use it in your Seed builds, update your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) (`seed.yml`) with something like this:

```yml
before_compile:
  - n 18.14.0
```

### Golang Versions

Seed uses [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) to manage versions internally. So if you want to use a different version of Golang than the one that is on the build image, add the following to your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) (`seed.yml`):

```yml
before_compile:
  - rm -r $HOME/.goenv && git clone https://github.com/syndbg/goenv.git $HOME/.goenv && goenv install 1.16.4 && goenv global 1.16.4
  - go version
```

## Running Locally

The build images used in Seed are hosted on Docker Hub — [**seedrun/build**](https://hub.docker.com/r/seedrun/build/tags)

These images are useful if you are trying to debug build issues. You can set up a Seed-like build environment locally to test your project.

To start the environment:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --privileged seedrun/build:general-purpose-5.0 bash
```

Make sure to select the build image your service is using.

The default working directory for builds in Seed is `/tmp/seed/source`. To clone the source, run:

```bash
$ mkdir -p /tmp/seed
$ cd /tmp/seed
$ git clone https://github.com/my/repo source
$ cd source
```

## Build Images
