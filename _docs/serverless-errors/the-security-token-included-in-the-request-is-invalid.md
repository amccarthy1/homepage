#### Error Message

> The security token included in the request is invalid

#### Problem

This happens when the AWS credentials used for your Serverless command are invalid. Or if they have not been configured on your machine.

#### Solution

Double-check your credentials. Or you can create a new pair of credentials. You can follow the chapter on [creating and IAM user](https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html) over on SST.

If you are trying to set up your local machine, run `aws configure` to set your credentials up.
